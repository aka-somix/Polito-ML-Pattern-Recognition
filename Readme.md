# Polito Machine Learning Pattern Recognition Labs

This repository is made to collect my personal solution for the laboratories of the course:
`Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition` of the Academic Year 2022/23

## Structure
I will try to keep everything nice and organized through the usage of **Jupyter Notebooks**, although I do not think is mandatory for the course, the exam, or anything else for what matters.



### About the Course:
You can find more about this Course (HERE)[https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01URTOV&p_a_acc=2021&p_header=S&p_lang=IT&multi=N]



### Python Version
I am currently using `Python 3.8` basically b/c I'm too lazy to update it.
